# Firstly, we print the list of students using the puts method.
puts "The students of Villains Academy"
puts "-------------"
puts "Dr. Hannibal Lecter"
puts "Darth Vader"
puts "Nurse Ratched"
puts "Michael Corleone"
puts "Alex DeLarge"
puts "The Wicked Witch of the West"
puts "Terminator"
puts "Freddy Krueger"
puts "The Joker"
puts "Joffrey Baratheon"
puts "Norman Bates"
=begin We then print the total number of students we have. 
       Here we use the 'print' method which allows us to divide the code between lines, because...
       unlike 'puts', print does not wrap the line.
=end
print "Overall, we have "
print 11
print " great students."
